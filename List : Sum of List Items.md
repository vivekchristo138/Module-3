# List Operations in Python: Sum of List Items

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that calculates the **sum of all elements** in a list.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Define a list of numbers.
2. Use Pythonâ€™s built-in `sum()` function to calculate the total.
3. Print the result.

## ðŸ§¾ Program
```
def createlist(a):
l = []
  for i in range(a):
  if i%2!=0:
      l.append(i)
print(l)
print(sum(l))
```

## Result
Thus the python program to find the sum of the list was created successfully.
